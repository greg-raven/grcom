				<h3>
					Suzanne Somers to be sacrificed
				</h3>
				<p>
					Actress Suzanne Somers this week confirmed rumors that she is still a virgin, and confided that the only man she will go all the way with is Surf Punk band Leader Dennis Dragon. Says Suzanne, &ldquo;I moved to the beach just to be near him. And when I get my hands on his body, the surf won&rsquo;t be the only thing that&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<p>
					Looks like you&rsquo;re in for a long hot Somers, there, Dennis.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Sophia and Carlo
				</h3>
				<p>
					Although Hollywood weddings are often thought of as temporary at best, Sophia Loren and husband Carlo Ponti have managed to remain together. Part of the reason, according to Sophia, is that they keep the excitement in their marriage by burying the children in the woods surrounding their home and then hunting them down with savage attack dogs. Says Sophia, &ldquo;Someday I suppose I&rsquo;ll write a book about it, but for right now it&rsquo;s a good way to keep my weight down.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<h3>
					Savalas uncovered
				</h3>
				<p>
					Producers for an upcoming CBS movie-for-TV have apparently changed their minds about using Telly Savalas as the male lead after discovering that Savalas is NOT a negro. Said one inside source, &ldquo;We were always told that he was John Amos&rsquo; twin brother. How were we supposed to know any different?&rdquo;
				</p>
				<h3>
					Jackie Smith despondent
				</h3>
				<p>

					Donny Osmond dead
				</h3>
				<p>
					Utah Sheriff&rsquo;s deputies told a press conference that they are holding Debra Glenn Osmond in connection with the death of her husband, singer Donny Osmond. So far, few details have been released concerning the incident, but it is believed that Donny starved to death in his home because his wife didn&rsquo;t know how to cook.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<h3>
					Mick Jagger lands a job
				</h3>
				<p>
					Although several dozen people crowded into the Ma Maison restaurant to party with Rolling Stone&rsquo;s singer Mick Jagger, none of them stayed to help Mick with the bill when Jagger discovered that he had left his wallet at home. As a result, Jagger was put to work washing dishes for the rest of the night. After he finally worked off his debt, however, owner Patrick Terrail begged him to stay on, and offered the millionaire $2.65 an hour to start. Said Terrail, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who that boy is, but he sure does know how to wash dishes. He&rsquo;ll probably get a raise real soon.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<h3>
					Dick Clark&rsquo;s youth secret
				</h3>
				<p>
					TV personality Dick Clark this week told POWER NEWS that he manages to stay the eternal teenager by drinking a glass of bodily secretions from sacrificial virgins prepared for him by KLOS air personality Al Ramirez. Says Clark, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do without my daily tonic, and it&rsquo;s getting harder and harder to find a virgin these days. But, if anyone can get them, Al can.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<h3>
					Letterman beats boredom
				</h3>
				<p>
					NBC morning man David Letterman told POWER NEWS that he has finally come up with a way to keep from being bored by the many people he meets. Says Letterman, &ldquo;Right after we shake hands, I grab a pair of pliers and pull out all of their teeth. It&rsquo;s better than drugs for me, and it really keeps my crew on their toes.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<h3>
					Rockefeller going nuts
				</h3>
				<p>
					The financial community was jolted this week with the rumor that billionaire David Rockefeller might be going insane. The speculation comes on the heels of a shopping spree in which Rockefeller entered a New York store and purchased forty-five thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of flasher dolls. Said Rockefeller, &ldquo;I wanted troll dolls, but they were all out.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<h3>
					Van Patten finds the way
				</h3>
				<p>
					POWER NEWS learned that actor Dick Van Patten credits ancient exotic religious rites for his marital bliss. Van Patten says that every morning he prays to his wife for sex and spare change, before going to work. Says Van Patten, &ldquo;This religion has made my life complete. I still take a lot of LSD, of course, but nobody&rsquo;s perfect.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<h3>
					Elke Sommer out for Soupy
				</h3>
				<p>
					Sexy actress Elke Sommer, who has raised the temperature of many a man in her day, herself has the hots, and it is for comedian Soupy Sales. Although Sales claims that he will have nothing to do with her, that hasn&rsquo;t stopped Sommer from sending Sales Volkswagens filled with marijuana. Says Sommer, &ldquo;Sooner or later, he&rsquo;s going to get the munchies, and when that happens, I&rsquo;ll be right there.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bon appetite!
				</p>
				<h3>
					Don Rickles gets his
				</h3>
				<p>
					When TV funny man Don Rickles decided to take advantage of modern-day hair transplant surgery to cover his bald spot, he knew that he was going to be in for some ribbing, but he didn&rsquo;t know just how far it would go. As a result, he was as surprised as anyone when he was picked up this week by Las Vegas Pest Control Authorities, who didn&rsquo;t recognise the comedian with a full head of hair. &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said Chief Officer William &ldquo;Bat&rdquo; Strangler, &ldquo;We thought he was one of those giant shrews from California we&rsquo;ve been hearing so much about.&rdquo; Rickles himself isn&rsquo;t laughing, but his wife told POWER NEWS, &ldquo;As fan as I know, Don isn&rsquo;t a shrew, but he <i>does</i> look a little like Leon Spinks.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<h3>
					Marie Osmond to be popped
				</h3>
				<p>
					Momma Osmond has evidently decided that it is finally time for daughter Marie Osmond to learn the facts of life, which is why she has given her approval for Marie to begin dating the rock band BTO. Says she, &ldquo;So far, I haven&rsquo;t been able to get ahold of their members, but I&rsquo;m sure that Marie will be able to.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<h3>
					Ma Maison ice capades
				</h3>
				<p>
					When the air conditioner broke down in the elite Ma Maison restaurant in Beverly Hills, owner Patrick Terrail playfully began tossing ice at his overheated patrons. When some of the diners complained, however, Terrail responded by locking the doors of the eatery and dumping garbage on their tables. When Terrail dumped a bucket of gravy over the head of regular customer David Niven, though, Niven decided that enough was enough, and stabbed Terrail with a butter knife. Said Niven, &ldquo;He should know better than to serve from the right like that.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<h3>
					Mick Jagger hassled in Little Tokyo
				</h3>
				<p>
					Well, it seems that the really big stars can never go anywhere without being harassed. I&rsquo;m talking about Mick Jagger, of course. Jagger, who was on his way to dinner with model Jeri Hall in Little Tokyo last night, flew into a rage after a pair of young men approached him and asked if he was comedian Frazer Smith. Jagger first tried to punch the young en, and then attacked the surprised contestants of the Japan Week Beauty Contest, while the two men grabbed Ms. Hall and ran. Jagger is recovering from wounds he received from the beauty contestants, but police have been unable to locate Ms. Hall.

				<h3>
					Travolta&rsquo;s lives
				</h3>
				<p>
					While many of his friends are worrying about a possible conviction on his recent animal morals charge, actor John Travolta is confident that he convinced the jury that it is natural for him to chase tine rodents and go on drinking binges with reptiles. Says John, &ldquo;I can prove I was a shrew in a past life. I only sleep two hours a day, and I often eat several times my body weight every 24 hours. I just hope that the judge isn&rsquo;t jealous of my fur.&rdquo;
				</p>
				<h3>
					Full moon out
				</h3>
				<p>
					Well, the full moon was out last night, and it belonged to none other than Marlon Brando. Brando, who is usually completely inaccessible, allegedly went on a binge and ordered his chauffeur to drive around at random while he flashed his moor at startled observers. Film at eleven.

					Thompson/Blues Brothers hoax backfires
				</h3>
				<p>
					Thursday night proved to be more than just the night before the weekend for more than three thousand passersby on Sunset Boulevard who noticed a large free-for-all party being held in the Tower Records parking lot. What started out as a hoax put on by writer Hunter S. Thompson and actors John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, however, soon assumed a different tone when thousands of people took their &ldquo;Nixon in 1980&rdquo; fundraiser seriously, and began showering the so-called promoters with money. Always the generous one&rsquo;s Belushi and Aykroyd have offered to use the money collected to help offset funeral expenses for the remains of several of the donors who were shot by Thompson for food for his Doberman puppies.
